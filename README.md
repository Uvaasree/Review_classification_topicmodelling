# Review Classification and Topic Modeling

## Problem Statement
In the age of online commerce, reviews play a crucial role in shaping consumer decisions. However, the proliferation of fake or misleading reviews significantly distorts consumer perceptions and undermines trust in online platforms.

This project aims to develop a robust system capable of:
1. **Classifying reviews** as fake or real using traditional machine learning models, deep learning models, and Transformers.
2. **Clustering similar reviews** to group related feedback and insights.
3. **Identifying underlying topics** in reviews to better understand customer sentiments and key issues.

## Business Use Cases
1. **Customer Trust**: Detect fake reviews to protect customers from misleading information.
2. **Product Feedback Analysis**: Group similar reviews to highlight common product issues or standout features.
3. **Content Moderation**: Automatically filter out fake or harmful reviews from product pages to ensure transparency and reliability.

## Approach
### Data Collection
- Utilize a **Fake Review Dataset** containing product reviews with textual content and metadata such as ratings, helpful votes, etc.

### Preprocessing
- **Text Cleaning**: Remove special characters, numbers, and stopwords.
- **Tokenization**: Split reviews into tokens (words or subwords).
- **Vectorization**: Convert text into numerical representations using methods like TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or Count Vectorizer.

### Topic Modeling (Unsupervised Learning)
Extract key themes from reviews using:
1. **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**: A probabilistic model that assigns words to topics.
2. **Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**: Factorizes word occurrence matrices to extract coherent topics.

### Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)
Group similar reviews based on content similarity:
1. **K-Means Clustering**: Partition reviews into K clusters (e.g., similar feedback, product categories).
2. **DBSCAN**: Density-based clustering that doesnâ€™t require predefined cluster counts.

### Fake Review Classification (Supervised Learning)
Classify reviews as fake or real using:
1. **Traditional Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
2. **Deep Learning Models**:
   - **LSTM**: Sequential modeling of text data.
   - **BERT**: Context-aware classification leveraging Transformers.

### Sentiment Analysis
Use a pretrained model (e.g., from Hugging Face) to predict the sentiment of each review (positive, negative, or neutral).

## Implementation Details

### Text Preprocessing
1. **Cleaning**: Remove unnecessary text elements like special characters and stopwords.
2. **Tokenization**: Break text into smaller, meaningful units.
3. **Vectorization**: Convert text into numerical format using methods like TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or Count Vectorizer.

### Topic Modeling
1. Use **LDA** or **NMF** to identify topics in the review dataset.
2. Assign reviews to topics based on word distributions.

### Clustering
1. Vectorize review text using TF-IDF or Word2Vec.
2. Apply clustering algorithms such as K-Means or DBSCAN.
3. Visualize clusters using dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA, t-SNE).

### Fake Review Classification
1. Tokenize and preprocess the review data.
2. Train models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LSTM, and BERT for classification tasks.
3. Evaluate models using metrics such as **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1 Score**.
4. Use ensemble methods to combine predictions from different models for improved performance.

### Sentiment Analysis
1. Apply a pretrained sentiment analysis model from Hugging Face.
2. Predict sentiments for individual reviews (positive, negative, neutral).
